a)   What is the difference between forEach, map, filter and reduce.Explain these using your own words ?

* forEach:- .forEach() is great you need to execute a function for each individual element in an array. Good practice is that you should use .forEach() when you can’t use other array methods to accomplish your goal. I know this may sound vague, but .forEach() is a generic tool… only use it when you can’t use a more specialized tool.

* map:- creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.calls a function once for each element in an array.does not execute the function for empty elements.

* filter:- method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function. method does not execute the function for empty elements.method does not change the original array.

* reduce:- The reduce() method executes a reducer function for each value of an array.

b)  Explain the difference between function declaration and arrow function ?

* function declaration:- It will tell compiler about the function name , its return type, and parameters
                         its a function statement which has parameters.
                         its defined using function keyword.
                         they will execute when they are called.
    syntax--    function functionName(parameters) {
                   //code 
                }

c) Explain the difference between find and findIndex ?

* find():- find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test.executes a function for each array element.find() method returns undefined if no elements are found.
find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.The find() method does not change the original array.

* findIndex:- Will return index of first array element that passes a test function.
              otherwise it returns -1

d) If you like to filter out one object element in an array which method do you like to use: filter or find ? Explain

* filter:- as it creates an array filled with all array elements.
           also its supported  by browsers.


e) Explain the difference of var, let and const when we declare a variable ?

  * var :- var is global scope & function scope 
           its global when its declared outside a function .. which means its available in use to the whole window.
           its function when its declared inside  a function (within).. which mean it can be access only inside function

  * let & const are block scope

    for let :- if variable is declared with let .. we can used only inside that block.
               it cant be re-declared bt can be updated
               if its not initialized will get reference error

    for const :- it can only be accessed when they are declared in a block.
                 it cant be updated or re-declared.
                 its imp to initialized when its declared.
